## Note for translators

- Folders
  - AMO Descriptions: description text used on AMO page
  - Addon Locales: locale strings in add-on itself
    - note that description keys are **NOT** required to be localized
- Translator list: it is located in option/about.html in addon source. Feel free to add yourself or contact owner for help.
- Code format: in Accept-Language header format but underscore is used instead of hyhpen.
- Perhaps [watch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories) this repository so that you can notified when strings are updated.
